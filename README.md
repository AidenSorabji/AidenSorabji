## Sup — I'm Aiden Sorabji 👨‍💻

I'm a Python programmer and an HTML writer based in Canada 🇨🇦.

_At the moment, I am trying to learn more about **HTML** and **Java** in addition to expanding my (already vast) knowledge of **Python**!_

## Some Skills I Have in Python 🐍
- Have mastered the basics of Python and have created advanced Python applications for multiple uses 
- Can create modules with multiple classes to efficiently and effectively simplify code
- Can create servers, API connectors, etc programs with ease  
- Can create a standalone _"application"_ which can virtually execute its designated function

**My main IDE is Visual Studio Code, but I am comfortable with Pycharm, terminal, etc.**
